Machine Learning Deep Learning Robotics Model
Deep Learning can be used in Robotics to control the movements and actions of robots. Here is an example using Keras in Python.
Input data (robotics_input_data.npy and robotics_output_data.npy) should be arrays containing information about the robot's movements and actions, such as sensor readings, joint angles, and joint velocities. The model is trained on this input data to predict the robot's next movement or action. The predicted outputs can then be used to control the robot's movements and actions in real-time.
